"""Container-level integration test for Doc 09 (endpoint actions) §8 / step 05
(docs/design/architecture-generalization/09-endpoint-actions/05-container-test.md):
a multi-endpoint deployment with three hosts — full default `actions`,
review-only override, and a `plain`-type host inheriting the default's
type-cut — is actually treated differently by a *real* Warden container, on
both the git axis and the REST axis.

Same blueprint as ``tests/container/test_multi_host.py`` (step 08): a real
``gitlab-warden`` service (via `catraz.compose`), driven with `docker compose
exec` + a stdlib `http.client` call carrying an explicit `Host` header — no
unit-level mock, no real forge behind these hostnames (see that module's
docstring for the full rationale, not repeated here).

Run (needs Docker):
    uv run --with pytest python -m pytest tests/container/test_multi_host_actions.py -q
